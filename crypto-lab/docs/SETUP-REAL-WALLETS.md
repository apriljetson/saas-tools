# Setting Up Real Wallets

## ⚠️ Important: Only You Can Create Real Wallets

I cannot create real wallets because:
- Private keys must be generated on YOUR hardware
- Only hardware wallets are truly secure
- I don't have access to physical devices

---

## Step-by-Step: Create Your Real Wallets

### 1. Buy a Hardware Wallet
**Required:**
- **Ledger** (ledger.com) - Recommended
- **Trezor** (trezor.io) - Also good

Order and wait for delivery. Don't expedite - security matters.

### 2. Set Up Ledger (Example)

1. Unbox your Ledger
2. Connect to computer via USB
3. Follow screen prompts
4. **WRITE DOWN SEED PHRASE ON PAPER**
   - Write each word in order
   - Double-check spelling
   - Store in SAFE LOCATION
5. Create PIN code

### 3. Install Apps

On your Ledger:
- Install Ethereum app
- Install Solana app (if using Solana)

### 4. Get Public Addresses

In Ledger Live:
- Click "Receive"
- Select crypto
- Verify address on device
- **COPY** (never type manually)

### 5. Add to Crypto Lab

1. Open `vault.html`
2. Click "Add Wallet"
3. Paste your PUBLIC address
4. Set type: cold/hot/newcoin
